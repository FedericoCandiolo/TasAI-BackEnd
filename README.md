# The project
TasAI is my Final Engineering Project (Proyecto Final de Ingenier√≠a) that I implemented for becoming a Systems Engineer. The project is mostly developed in Spanish in compliance with the university's requirements.

The team implemented the project based on the client-server architecture. Please check the FrontEnd repository in my projects.
